Ezekiel: "How are you, Grandma Ester?"
Grandma Ester: "I am doing well, Young One."
Ezekiel: "What is that thing you are... riding around?"
Grandma Ester: "Oh! I found this new thing from the Barn and it cuts the grass for me automatically! \nHow wonderful this new 'technology' is!"
Ezekiel: "What tarnation! Grandma Ester... You know that we can't be using those. We are Amish."
Grandma Ester: "But this technology is so cool! You should try it once Ezekiel."
