Ezekiel: "Grandma Eether, do you happen to know where any talismans are?"
Grandma Esther: "Hmm? I dont believe so. Why do you need them?"
Ezekiel: "Grandma Esther. I need those talismans. To save you and everyone else."
Grandma Esther: "I may have dropped one in the wheat f... I meant I didn't drop any talismans!"
*Drops more hints about talismans*
Ezekiel: "Thank you Grandma Esther. You will go back to normal."
