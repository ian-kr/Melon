Amish Adventures
-----------------------------

The Protagonist: Ezekiel White
He is the local detective of the town of Charm, Ohio.



Story:

Prologue
----------------
When walking around, Ezekiel noticed people of Charm, Ohio started to use technology that
the locals have found in a strangely placed barn in the middle of a farmer's wheat field.

When Ezekiel started to investigate the situation, he found a golden cow walking around	the barn. 
He was obviously eating the wheat that the barn was conveniently placed over to fuel his reign.

After a hard, long, think, Ezekiel decided that the cow must have some control over the people of Charm, Ohio.
The best way in order to get rid of this wicked control is to collect the different traditional Amish charms from around
the village in order to stop the golden cow in its tracks.

Mid section
----------------------
He goes and talks to the local, firstly trying to find their charms. The locals first deny there is any charms (as the cow knows
that the charms would destroy him) and then eventually after some finding, Ezekiel will find them.

Barn Confrontation
----------------------------------
One by one (there will probably be 3) he collects them and then confronts the cow at the barn.

The cow gives him an option to run away and test out the modern technology and if he does, then Ezekiel will run from being Amish 
all the way into Utah where he switches to be a mormon.

The cow then challenges Ezekiel to a fight if he does stay. The charms then become life size, helping him out on the boss fight. 

If he wins, he is celebrated to bringing the tradition of the Amish back to life.

If he loses, the cow takes over Ezekiel's mind and then takes over the village of Charm, Ohio.
